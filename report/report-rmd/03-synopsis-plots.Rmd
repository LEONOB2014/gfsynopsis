# SYNOPSIS PLOTS: TYPE A SPECIES {#sec:synopsis-plots-A}

The following two sections contain the main species-by-species data
visualizations. Each species is shown on two pages with the same layout used
throughout. See the previous section (Section (\@ref(sec:plot-descriptions))
for detailed figure captions. The species are ordered according to DFO species
codes. The table of contents at the beginning of the document includes links to
the species pages in order of species codes, and Sections
(\@ref(sec:common-name-index)) and Section (\@ref(sec:scientific-name-index))
provide links to the pages sorted alphabetically by common and scientific name
alphabetically, respectively.
