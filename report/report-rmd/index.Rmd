abstract: |
  The combination of fishery-dependent data, such as catch and effort, and fishery-independent survey data, such as biomass indices and age compositions, forms the backbone of most fisheries stock assessments. For British Columbia groundfish fisheries, vast quantities of such data are collected annually, with 100% at-sea observer coverage, 100% dockside monitoring of landings, and deployment of  multiple trawl, trap, and hook-and-line surveys. However, there is not the capacity to conduct formal annual stock assessments for most stocks, and therefore much of this data is not regularly published or readily accessible.  Here, we introduce a reproducible report to give a snapshot of long-term and recent population and fishing trends, plus data availability for 110 groundfish species in British Columbia. The report generation is fully automated --- pulling data from databases, fitting models, generating visualizations, and stitching the document together to facilitate annual publication, reproducibility, and transparency. Our goals are: (1) to facilitate regular review by groundfish scientists and managers of trends in survey indices and stock composition to potentially flag stocks for prioritized assessment; (2) to generate standardized datasets and visualizations that will help assessment scientists develop operating models and select candidate management procedures as part of a planned management-procedure framework for data-limited groundfish stocks; and (3) to increase data transparency between Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the fishing industry, non-governmental organizations, and the public.
