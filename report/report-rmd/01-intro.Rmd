# INTRODUCTION {#sec:intro}

The combination of fishery dependent data, such as catch and effort, and
fishery independent survey data, such as biomass indices and age
compositions, form the backbone of most fisheries stock assessment.
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) at the Pacific Biological Station
(PBS) manages vast quantities of such data on groundfish species in
British Columbia (BC). However, we (DFO Science Branch, Pacific Region
stock assessment scientists) lack the capacity to conduct formal stock
assessments for most stocks annually, and therefore, much of these data
are not regularly published or readily accessible.

As one step to address this problem, we have created a data synopsis
report to give a snapshot of long-term and recent population and fishing
trends and data availability for all major British Columbia groundfish
stocks of commercial and conservation interest. The report is an
extension of the data scorecard concept discussed at a Canadian Science
Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) Regional Peer Review Meeting in May 2016
[@macdougall2016]. We plan to publish this report as a CSAS Research
Document in its first year and to update the report annually as a CSAS
Science Response in subsequent years. The report generation is fully
automated --- pulling data from databases, fitting models, generating
visualizations, and stitching the document together to facilitate rapid
publication.

<!-- TODO: Fix proceedings reference should be DFO as author -->

Our (the authors') goals with this report are to (1) facilitate
groundfish scientists and managers regularly reviewing trends in survey
indices and stock composition across all stocks to potentially flag
stocks for prioritized assessment; (2) generate standardized datasets,
biological model fits, and visualizations that will help assessment
scientists develop operating models and select candidate management
procedures as part of a planned management procedure framework for
data-limited and data-moderate groundfish stocks; and (3) increase data
transparency between Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the fishing industry,
First Nations, non-governmental organizations, and the general public.

## REPORT STRUCTURE

The synopsis report is comprised of two-page species-by-species
subsections that visually synthesize most available data for each
species. The report focuses on the most important species to track for
commercial and conservation concern, as outlined in the current BC
groundfish strategic plan, and focuses on the surveys and data types
applicable to the widest array of these fish stocks. Currently, we have
focused on the 31 A-level species, which are identified as the main
species of commercial and conservation interest. The strategic plan also
includes a set of B-level species (number TODO), which may be added in a
future update of the report.

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same way. A
set of pages starts with the species common name, the species scientific
name, and the DFO species code, which usually corresponds to the page
number referencing the species in @hart1988. The figures themselves are
laid out such that the first page has survey timeseries trends and
spatial patterns on the left and commercial timeseries and spatial
patterns on the right. The second page is focused on biological samples.
This page begins at the top with length and age data and their
relationship with each other, then shows data on maturity, and finishes
with an overview of available numbers of sampled fish across all survey
and commercial samples for various biological measurements.

In terms of surveys, we have focused on the Synoptic Bottom Trawl
surveys, the Outside Hard Bottom Long Line surveys (HBLL; alternatively
referred to as the Pacific Halibut Management Association, PHMA,
surveys), and the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)
surveys (Fig. \@ref(fig:intro-maps)) because these provide the greatest spatial and
taxonomic coverage of the stocks in this report. As an example, we are
not showing biomass index trends or maps from the Sablefish trap
surveys, since these are highly selective for Sablefish. However, we do
include counts of available fish specimens from biological samples on
all surveys and fit biological models such as growth models to all
available data.

TODO: something here or elsewhere on the management areas and perhaps something about how will they line up with the survey areas.

Following the species-by-species visualizations, we include a section
providing details on the data extraction from the relational databases
that hold the raw data, a section providing details on the models that
underlie some of the visualizations, and finally a bibliography
including all references listed on the figure pages themselves. In
navigating the report, we suggest that the report is best viewed in a
PDF two-page view so that all the plots for a single species can be
viewed at once. We also note that the table of contents and references
are clickable hyperlinks to facilitate navigation.

We made a number of overarching design decisions in structuring the
report:

1. Each species is displayed with the same layout to facilitate finding a
type of data, comparing stocks, and identifying missing data via empty
plots.

1. We have limited the report to two pages per species so that all plots
can be laid out at once on a screen in a PDF. The data presentation is
dense, but we believe there is value in being able to compare all the
data for a species at once.

1. The colours representing the various surveys are held constant to
facilitate tracing a single survey throughout the plots.

1. The colour scales are consistent for the survey maps and survey
biological specimen number plots and for the commercial catch per unit
effort maps and commercial biological specimen number plots (the bottom
plots on both pages).

1. Data on female fish are always shown in front of data on male fish and
are either coloured or black whereas males are always indicated with
light grey. We did this to focus mainly on female fish, which are often
more important in stock assessment models.

## CAVEATS

There are many caveats when interpreting this report. First, the
synopsis report is not intended to be a substitute for stock assessment.
For example, although relative biomass indices from surveys can indicate
the biomass trend for a species in an area, such information is best
combined with other information such as removals by commercial catches
and information on the age- or length-composition of the stock to make
conclusions about about the status of a stock. Second, biomass indices
from trawl or longline surveys and commercial catch per unit effort
indices need careful interpretation on a stock-by-stock basis. We have
attempted to flag survey index trends that may be especially suspect
either because of high survey variability or because of a small fraction
of trawl or long line sets containing the species, but this is not a
guarantee in itself. Survey indices are not always representative of
abundance for a variety of reasons --- changes through time, including
fish behavioural changes, could also result in biases through time.
Commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) timeseries, even when
standardized for consistent time of year, depth, latitude, and vessel
need to be considered even more carefully. There are a multitude of
reasons why commercial CPUE trends may not represent underlying trends
in abundance [e.g. @harley2001]. Nonetheless, we think there is value in
transparently displaying the available data for all species.

To be continued ...

## UPDATE SCHEDULE

We plan to publish annual updates of this synopsis report as Science
Response documents. These annual updates will include another year of
data and any important corrections to the data, text, or visualizations.
On a less frequent basis we will consider making any larger changes to
the structure or content of the groundfish data synopsis report. We will
consider these larger possible revisions approximately every three
years.

## GFPLOT AND GFSYNOPSIS R PACKAGES

As stated above, one goal of this report is to generate standardized
data sets, model fits, and visualizations to facilitate stock
assessment. We intend for the data extraction and plots developed here
to be useful for the upcoming management-procedure framework for
data-limited and data-moderate groundfish stocks in BC, but also for the
preparation of other groundfish stock assessments and to facilitate
data-to-document workflows that go straight from databases to the final
report via code and can be quickly updated in future years. To that end,
all data extraction, data manipulation, model fitting, and visualization
for this report is accomplished via the R package gfplot, which the
authors developed for this purpose. The specific layout and tools needed
to make this report are created with a second R package, gfsynopsis.
Both packages (but not the data itself) are publicly available on
GitHub:\
<https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfplot>\
<https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfsynopsis>.
