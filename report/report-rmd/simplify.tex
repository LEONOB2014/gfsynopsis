\subsection{CONSTRUCTING SERIES&nbsp;C (ALL HOOKS, COASTWIDE) AND COMPARING IT WITH SERIES&nbsp;B (ALL HOOKS, NORTH OF VANCOUVER ISLAND)}\label{sec:compareBC}

% From CST-YYR/compareB-C.tex, pretty much straight in and taking out the first figure, and adding in directory name for figures.

We now construct Series&nbsp;C, which is for all hooks from each skate (like for
Series&nbsp;B) but covers the whole coast, including the WCVI (unlike Series&nbsp;B), as
was summarised in Table&nbsp;\ref{tab:seriesSumm}. We then show that Series&nbsp;B (north
of VI) and Series&nbsp;C (whole coast) are similar over the overlapping years, and so
Series&nbsp;B can be considered representative of the whole coast, i.e.&nbsp;the
population off the WCVI is not showing a different relative trend to the rest of
the coast, as demonstrated above for Series&nbsp;A
and&nbsp;D. % For B and C it turns out the absolute catch rates were different, but the relative year-to-year changes looked the same.

Figure&nbsp;\ref{fig:CST-YYR/bcaKeepSerBC1}(a) shows the absolute catch rate index
for Series&nbsp;B (all hooks, north of VI), together with the shorter time series for
Series C (all hooks, coastwide, for 2003-2012 and 2014). For all overlapping
years, the Series&nbsp;C means and confidence intervals are less than those for
Series&nbsp;B.

For Series&nbsp;B, define $G'_{B}$ to be the geometric mean of the bootstrapped
annual means, with the geometric mean based only the years that overlap with
Series&nbsp;C (i.e.&nbsp;2003 to 2012 and 2014). Define $G_C$ similarly for Series C. By
dividing the bootstrapped values for each series by their respective geometric
means, we obtain Figure&nbsp;\ref{fig:CST-YYR/bcaKeepSerBC1}(b). The rescaled means
are very close to each other, such that for the overlapping years the temporal
patterns for Series&nbsp;B and Series&nbsp;C are very similar. (Values for Series B and
Series C are given in Tables \ref{tab:bcaKeepSerB} and&nbsp;\ref{tab:bcaKeepSerC},
respectively, and for the rescaled series in Tables&nbsp;\ref{tab:serBscaled}
and&nbsp;\ref{tab:serCscaled}).

Thus the relative patterns for Series&nbsp;B and Series&nbsp;C appear similar for the
overlapping years. But the absolute catch rates in
Figure&nbsp;\ref{fig:CST-YYR/bcaKeepSerBC1}(a) show that inclusion of the WCVI
stations in Series&nbsp;C consistently reduces the catch rates from those of Series&nbsp;B
(that did not include the WCVI stations). So while inclusion of the WCVI
stations does not appear to change the \emph{relative} pattern of the index of
the population, it does change the absolute values. Therefore the stations off
the WCVI have to be included or excluded consistently to construct an index
series; since we have more years that do not have stations off the WCVI
(Table&nbsp;\ref{tab:seriesSumm}), we consistently exclude these stations (giving
Series&nbsp;B).

The stations off the WCVI have lower average catch rates than the remaining
stations. Excluding them in Series&nbsp;B increases the (geometric and arithmetic)
means of the catch rates by 11\% (Table&nbsp;\ref{tab:serCscaled}) compared to
Series&nbsp;C. Thus, in Figure&nbsp;\ref{fig:CST-YYR/bcaKeepSerBC1}(a) we cannot simply
join up the 1995 and 1996 Series&nbsp;B values with the Series&nbsp;C values for the other
years, because the 1995 and 1996 values exclude stations off the WCVI that
appear (at least for the later years that we have data for) to have lower catch
rates.

So the population off the WCVI appears to be changing in the same way as the
rest of the coast for the overlapping years (2003-2012 and 2014), it just has
lower catch rates in the IPHC survey than for the rest of the coast. Thus,
Series&nbsp;B can be considered to be an index of the coastwide population for the
overlapping years.

  given year, the catch rate for each set is calculated from

\section{CONCLUSION -- SERIES&nbsp;AB IS THE LONGEST IPHC SERIES WE CAN CONSTRUCT AND CAN BE CONSIDERED A COASTWIDE INDEX}

For all years that comparisons could be made, the two Series that exclude
stations off the WCVI (Series&nbsp;A and&nbsp;B) demonstrated the same relative temporal
patterns as the two Series that included the stations off the WCVI (Series&nbsp;D
and&nbsp;B, respectively), and so we assume that the same holds for the few years for
which we are unable to make such a comparison (namely 1995-1998 and 2000). Since
Series&nbsp;AB is the longest that we are able to construct it would be a suitable
index for the assessment model, and we consider it to be an index of the
coastwide population for all years.

We would therefore recommend that the absolute catch rate index for Series AB in
Figure&nbsp;\ref{fig:bcaKeepSerAB1}(b), with values in Table&nbsp;\ref{tab:serAB}, could
be used an input to an assessment model. But for this stock assessment of
\spName&nbsp;the index from Appendix&nbsp;C was used.

We note that Series&nbsp;AB does show a somewhat abrupt drop in catch rates between
2001 and 2002 (a 48\% drop in the sample mean from 1.77 to 0.92). The survey
report for 2002 \citep{dvr03} suggests no methodological reason for such a
decline, since `survey station design and most sampling protocols were left
unchanged from 2001'. Indeed, when comparing the design and sampling protocols
with those from 2001 \citep{dvr02}, we see no alterations that would lead to a
drop in catch rates of \spName. For Pacific Halibut, Figure&nbsp;2 of \citet{dvr03}
only shows an 8\% drop in catch rates (pounds per skate) from 2001 to 2002 (and
a 6\% increase from 1999 to 2002), further suggesting that there is not a
methodological reason for the survey to have lower catch rates (in general) in
2002 compared to 2001.

\section{DISCUSSION}
% \section{From IPHChookanalysis.tex:}

Future uses of the IPHC survey data for Canadian Pacific groundfish stock
assessments could investigate the use of, for example, generalised linear
models. There was not time to do so for this assessment, but the extensive data
processing and associated R code developed for this work should prove useful for
such work.

Also, further methods could be considered, such as the delta-gamma method
(e.g. \citealt{lbaebp13}) that would explicitly model the zero catch rates seen
for some sets. For the Redbanded Rockfish assessment, it was not clear \emph{a
  priori} whether or not the delta-gamma method would lead to reduced
coefficients of variation for the catch rates (Jean-Baptiste Lecomte, Pacific
Biological Station, Nanaimo, BC, pers.&nbsp;comm.). The method used here does not
explicitly account for the expected increased number of sets with zero catches
in 2012 compared to other years (recall that the bait experiment in 2012 meant
that only four skates could be used from each set). However, 2012 did not have
the highest proportion of zero catches (Table&nbsp;\ref{tab:serAB}) and does not look
anomalous (Figure \ref{fig:bcaKeepSerAB1}), and so the methods used here appear
to be suitable.
