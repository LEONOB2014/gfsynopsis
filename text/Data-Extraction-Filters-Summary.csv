get-commercial-biology.sql,,"filtered for SPECIMEN_SEX_CODE 1,2 (sexed as male/female)",To extract only those records with specimen sex recorded
,,filtered for SAMPLE_SOURCE_CODE 1 (unsorted samples),To extract only samples which were unsorted (some of which are discarded) to avoid sampling bias
,,"filtered for USABILITY_CODE 0,1,2,6 (usable samples)","To remove samples from incomplete surveys, when gear was damaged, or other sampling errors"
,,filtered for FE_PARENT_EVENT_ID null ,To extract data at only one level - some data are also recorded in the database at higher or lower levels with separate fishing event ID's
